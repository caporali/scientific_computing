# Scientific Computing
<p> Scientific Computing exam project at University of Pisa. The paper follows a research article that considers the preconditioned conjugate gradient method as an algorithm to accelerate the search for the solution vector of the GeneRank problem. The work is written completely in Italian. <p>

Title of the project:
<ul>
  <li> <em>Metodo del gradiente coniugato con precondizionamento
applicato al problema del GeneRank</em> (original) </li>
  <li> <em>Preconditioned conjugate gradient method applied to the GeneRank problem</em> (english version) </li>
</ul>

# Description
The source code for the simulations can be found in the [code](https://github.com/caporali/scientific_computing/tree/main/code) folder. It is completely written in Matlab. <br>
It consists of a comparison between the method in analysis and other known algorithms in the literature (jacobi, gauss-seidel...). It is found in the [code](https://github.com/caporali/scientific_computing/tree/main/code/) folder. The main code to be executed is [main.mat](https://github.com/caporali/scientific_computing/blob/main/code/main.m).

All files are accompanied by brief comments (written mostly in Italian). <br>
